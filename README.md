# MathematicsProjects
Projects, including combinatorics poker problems and Fibonacci, that I completed during my time studying at CPP. The Graph Theory Draft is the only copy my group has when we made that project, since the final copy got corrupted. Apologies in advance if any of these might be difficult to read, since most are handwritten. I can always clarify anything you need!
